#Licenses

The 'peer-crdt' project has been used as a basis for this project,
and the license file of this project has been included in this folder.

Changes made to the original project include the conversion
of the project to TypeScript, and the removal on the dependence
on a peer-to-peer network.
These changes were made in order to allow a more general
framework for nested CRDTs.
What was mostly unaffected are the included pre-defined CRDT types,
which were mainly converted to TypeScript only.
